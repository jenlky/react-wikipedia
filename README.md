This project was created with create-react-app, bootstrap container, HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. I learnt a lot in the process. I learnt - of the existence and use of React.Fragment, that Chrome's responsive tool isn't accurate, how to use grid/table, the pros and cons of table etc. 

Grid is really powerful! I'm going to spend extra time to learn and practise it and flexbox.

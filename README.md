# React Wikipedia Viewer

Link: https://www.jenlky.com/projects/react-wikipedia/

This website searches the typed word at Wikipedia and returns the top 10 results. When you click on any of the results, it directs you to the said result.

This project was created with Create React App, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and vanilla Javascript. It is responsive and mobile friendly, uses CSS grid for layout and Wikipedia OpenSearch api. 

I learnt a lot in the process. I learnt about React.Fragment, that Chrome's responsive tool isn't entirely accurate since it's a simulation, how to use grid/table, the pros and cons of table etc.
